						<h2 class="major">Social Impact</h2>
						<p>We believe that talent is equally distributed around the world, but opportunity is not. We want to change how the world works.</p>

						<p>Impact Sourcing is a socially responsible arm of the Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) industry that intentionally employs people
							who have limited opportunity for employment - often in low-income areas.</p>

						<p>At WebMonks, we like to take that definition one step further by investing in our workforce and emphasizing personal development that brings hope to families and communities.
							We don't view Impact Sourcing as simply a strategy or just the latest fad in sustainable development initiatives.
							Instead, the goal of positively impacting the lives of workers and their families drives every facet of our business.</p>
