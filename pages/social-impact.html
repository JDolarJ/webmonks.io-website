                    <p>The potential that people possess, is equally distributed around the globe. However, not everyone 
                       gets equal opportunities to develop that potential into skills, or to use the skills they have.
                       Restoring the balance between potential and opportunities is why we exist.</p>

                    <h3 class="major">Impact Sourcing?</h3>
                    <p>Impact Sourcing is the socially responsible form of outsourcing, which intentionally employs people
                        who have limited opportunity for quality jobs - often in low-income areas. WebMonks brings quality
                            careers in which people can develop themselves through their own talent. The area we target is
                            currently one of the most difficult countries to live in - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela">Venezuela.</a>
                            </p>

                    <p>We don't view Impact Sourcing as simply a strategy or just the latest fad in sustainable development initiatives.
                        Instead, the goal of positively impacting the lives of workers and their families drives every facet of our business.</p>

                    <p>WebMonks doesn't limit itself to bringing quality jobs to economically depressed areas. We do the same
                       for education: providing quality training for people to develop their talent. With a training that is

                       skills up to an engineering level in Computer Vision and Machine Learning.</p>
