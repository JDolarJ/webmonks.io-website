                    <p>Impact Sourcing is a socially responsible arm of the Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) industry that intentionally employs people
                        who have limited opportunity for employment - often in low-income areas.</p>

                    <p>At WebMonks, we like to take that definition one step further by investing in our workforce and emphasizing personal development that brings hope to families and communities.
                        We don't view Impact Sourcing as simply a strategy or just the latest fad in sustainable development initiatives.
                        Instead, the goal of positively impacting the lives of workers and their families drives every facet of our business.</p>

                    <h3 class="major">Why we do it?</h3>
                    <p>Our belief system is what drives us, what shapes WebMonks and guides our strategy and
                        decisions. This is the very core of why we exist, the foundation for what we do and how we
                        do it:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Potential is equally distributed across the globe, but opportunity is not.</li>
                        <li>The future of work is distributed. Internet and technology are closing distances,
                            especially for digital jobs.</li>
                        <li>Sustainable improvements for individuals and their communities comes from trade, not
                        aid.</li>
                        <li>The higher the intellectual level of a job, the higher the probability for large social
                        impact on its community.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The first one is what it’s really all about: balancing out opportunities for the talents
                        that people possess. The other ones contribute to how we actually pursue that goal. If you
